1. Dijkstra
                        heapdict            hash            heap
Time complexity:       O((V+E)logV)       O(V^2+E)       O((V+E)logE)
Space complexity:       O(V+E)             O(V+E)          O(V+E)

2. TSP
Space complexity: 2^n*n
Time complextiy: 2^n*n

Debriefing (required!): --------------------------

0. Deqing Qu
1. 8 hours
2. difficult
3. I worked on it mostly alone
4. 80%
5. I made several mistakes when I worked on Dijkstra and can't pass all test cases at first. Dijkstra is not as easy as
previous homework and you have to choose the right data structure to store data, or you will have a time limited exceeded
error. Eventually, I use a set to store the visited vertices instead of an array and all test cases are passed.
