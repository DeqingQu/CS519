(a) The time complexity of push in heap is O(logn) and the time complexity of push n elements to heap is O(nlogn)
The time complexity of heapify can be presented as n/2 + n/4*2 + n/8*3 + n/2^h*h = O(n)

(b)
# test time of heapify
def test1():
    a = list(range(100000))
    random.shuffle(a)
    heapq.heapify(a)

# test time of push each element to heap
def test2():
    a = list(range(100000))
    random.shuffle(a)
    heap = []
    for x in a:
        heapq.heappush(heap, x)

nbesta: O(N^2 + N^2*logN^2) = O(N^2logN)
nbestb: O(N^2 + N^2 + NlogN) = O(N^2)
nbestc: O(2*NLogN + logN) = O(NlogN)


2. The time complexity of k-way merge sort is still O(NlogN)
The time complexity of merging k sorted array is O(NlogK). All elements will push to the heap whose size is K and the time consumed is logK times of N.
N elements will slip into k groups and this operation will execute logkN times. So the total time complexity is NlogK * logkN = NlogN.


3. The time complexity of k smallest number in data stream is O(nlogk)
The size of heap is k and the time complexities of push, pop, replace are all O(k). The time consumed on pushing all elements to heap is O(nlogk).
The time complexity of pop all elements in heap is O(klogk), so the total time complexity is O(nlogk + klogk) = O(nlogk)

The time complexity of closest_sorted_slow is O(n + logn + k)
The time complexity of closest_sorted_slow2 is O(logn + n + k)

Debriefing (required!): --------------------------
0. Deqing Qu
1. 6 hours or more
2. difficult. Q1 and Q2 are difficult and I spend a lot time on them.
3. I worked alone first, but I found some questions that I can't solve alone. I am confused whether we can sort the result after qselect and asked TA some questions in his office hour.
4. 90%
5. The material of the class is becoming more difficult and I have to spend more time on this class. The questions in homework are very interesting and let us have a deeper understanding of the material in this class.
6. nothing
