Debriefing (required!): --------------------------

0. Deqing Qu
1. more than 6 hours
2. difficult
3. I worked on it alone
4. 90%
5. Q3 in hw10 and TSP are the most difficult and challenging questions in this class. Comparing to coding, how to get the
 idea of the solution is the most difficult part of the problem and I possibly can't figure out the solution alone. After
 Dr. Huang explained all solutions on class, it is not so hard to implement them in python.
6. None.
