The time complexity of Fibonacci is O(n). Though f(n) grows exponentially, each f(n) is calculated once.

1.
The time complexity of Maximum Weighted Independent Set is O(n)

2.
The time complexity of number of BSTs is O(n^2).
Catalan number.
In combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively-defined objects. They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eug√®ne Charles Catalan.


Debriefing (required!): --------------------------

0. Deqing Qu
1. 3 hours
2. easy. The material of DP in week 5 is easier than week 4.
3. I work on it alone.
4. 90%
5. The questions about DP are very interesting.
6. It would be better if the 'submit' program has a parameter 'overwrite'. For the assignment of this week, I can't update mis.py after I did some changes in max_wis2 function, because the running time of max_wis function is the same.
